# Usage and Design

The native digital cryptographically-secured utility token of the EPNS protocol \(**$EPNS**\) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the EPNS protocol, which is designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the EPNS protocol and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token on the network.

$EPNS tokens are used to control various core functionalities of the EPNS protocol, allowing users to vote on features of the protocol. For the avoidance of doubt, the right to vote is restricted solely to voting on features of the EPNS protocol; the right to vote does not entitle $EPNS holders to vote on the operation and management of the Company, the Distributor or their respective affiliates, or their assets, and does not constitute any equity interest in any of the aforementioned entities. For example, the protocol fees are charged in **$ETH** or **$DAI** within the EPNS protocol, but the $EPNS token holders may vote to change these fee parameters.

All fees collected from the EPNS protocol usage forms the ​**Fees pool** ​and will be distributed in the following proportion:

**30%​** of **Fees Pool** forms **Ecosystem development pool**

| **Ecosystem development pool \(EDP\)​ Breakdown** |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\* | **x%**​ for Integration partners pool |
|  | **y%**​ for Future integration reward pool |
|  | Where​ **x%**​ + **​y%**​ = ​**100%​** of **E​DP** |

The major decision and usage of the protocol tokens are:

* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining micro-fees paid per notifications by the service provider.
* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining monthly/yearly subscription fees.
* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining Indirect subscription fees percentage to be taken when a service provider adds a wallet address without the explicit consent of the user.
* **Protocol Fees:​** Defining Penalty fees for updating service name, icon, url, etc.
* **Governance:** ​Configuring SPAM throttle index.
* **Governance:**​ Adjusting percentage allocation of various Integration partners pool from ecosystem development pool through governance proposal.
* **Governance:** ​Adjusting percentage allocation of Future integration reward pool from ecosystem development pool through governance proposal.
* **Staking and Voting:** ​Token holders are allowed to create and move proposals by staking certain percentage of tokens to put them up for voting. These tokens are locked and are eligible for withdrawal only after a 30 day locking period to ensure serious users perform such functions.
* **Liquidity Mining:​** Service providers will be rewarded with our tokens for the next few years for increasing their activities within the ecosystem, with more rewards going to higher subscriber count and notifications sent. This will create a new subsection of service providers \(ie: vendor\), that are third party developers who are not affiliated to official services but create channels to capitalize on token rewards for providing quality content.
* **Liquidity Mining:** ​To encourage more users to vote on proposals and to enable further decentralization, the voting will result in rewards in terms of governance tokens.
* **User incentives:** Users will be able to earn token incentives based on some of their direct or indirect actions within the EPNS protocol, for example directly subscribing to channels, or being indirectly subscribed by a channel \(channel pays user either the default minor reward, or the reward expectation set by the individual user\).
* **Note:** ​When a user withdraws their earnings, the aDAI accrued is swapped for the protocol’s governance token and is given to them.

The token design and usage is still in discussion and might result in some further tweaks in design. The document specs will freeze as we move from draft to final.
