# Usage and Design

**$EPNS**​ tokens, the ​protocol’s native governance token​ is used to control various core functionalities of the protocol. The fees are charged in ​**$ETH**​ or **​$DAI** ​within the protocol but the control to change the various fees lies with the governance token holders.

All fees collected from the EPNS protocol usage forms the ​**Fees pool** ​and will be distributed in the following proportion:

Fees pool​ = **70%​** for **Token holders**, **30%​** for **the Ecosystem development pool**

| Ecosystem development pool \(EDP\)​ Breakdown |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| \*\*\*\* | **x%**​ for Integration partners pool |
|  | **y%**​ for Future integration reward pool |
|  | Where​ **x%**​ + **​y%**​ = ​**100%​** of E​DP |

The major decision and usage of the protocol tokens are:

* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining micro-fees per notifications by the service provider.
* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining monthly subscription fees.
* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining yearly subscription fees.
* **Protocol Fees:** ​Defining Indirect subscription fees percentage to be taken when a

  service provider adds a wallet address without the explicit consent of the user.

* Protocol Fees:​ Defining Penalty fees for updating service name, icon, url, etc.
* **Governance:** ​Configuring SPAM throttle index.
* **Governance:**​ Adjusting percentage allocation of various Integration partners pool

  from ecosystem development pool through governance proposal.

* **Governance:** ​Adjusting percentage allocation of Future integration reward pool from

  ecosystem development pool through governance proposal.

* **Staking and Voting:** ​Token holders are allowed to create and move proposals by

  staking certain percentage of tokens to put them up for voting. These tokens are locked and are eligible for withdrawal only after a 30 day locking period to ensure serious players move these proposals.

* **Liquidity Mining:​** Service providers will be rewarded with our tokens for the next few years with more rewards going to higher subscriber count and notifications sent. This will create a new subsection of service providers \(ie: vendor\), that are third party developers who are not affiliated to official services but create channels to capitalize on token rewards for providing quality content.
* **Liquidity Mining:** ​To encourage more users to vote on proposals and to enable

  further decentralization, the voting will result in rewards in terms of governance

  tokens.

* **Note:** ​When a user withdraws their earnings, the aDAI accrued is swapped for the

  protocol’s governance token and is given to them.

* **Note:** ​The ecosystem development pool allocation from the fees pool is non-adjusted

  \(i.e. will remain at **30% of fees pool**\).

* **Note:** ​The share of token holders from Fees pool is non-adjustable \(i.e. will remain at

  **70% of fees pool**\).

{% hint style="info" %}
The token holders share was adjusted from **80%** to **70%** to create a reward pool & incentive structure for all wallets.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The token design and usage is still in discussion and might result in some further tweaks in the  design. The document specs will freeze as we move from draft to final.
