# Claiming Token incentives from Protocol

## Claiming Token incentives

The protocol provides ways for users to receive token incentives based on some of their direct or indirect actions. These include incentives resulting from:

* Subscribing to channels by their direct action \(receive token incentives\).
* Indirect subscribe by a channel \(channel pays user either the default minor reward or the reward expectation set by the user\).

These token incentives are mapped to the user in the protocol and the user is free to claim these anytime they want to. The token incentives are generated and kept as [aDai \(AAVE Interest bearing DAI\)](https://aave.com/aTokens) for users to keep generating token incentives automatically for them. They are converted to protocol tokens when the user withdraws them.
