# Claiming Earnings from Protocol

## Claiming Earnings

The protocol provides ways for users to earn token incentives based on some of their direct or indirect actions. These include earnings resulting from:

* Subscribing to channels by their direct action \(earn token incentives\).
* Indirect subscribe by a channel \(channel pays user either the default minor reward or the reward expectation set by the user\).

These earnings are mapped to the user in the protocol and the user is free to claim these anytime they want to. The earning are generated and kept as [aDai \(AAVE Interest bearing DAI\)](https://aave.com/aTokens) for users to keep generating token incentives automatically for them. They are converted to protocol tokens when the user withdraws them.
