# Channels Registry

## Concept

The channels registry is maintained in the protocol to carry out various tasks such as carrying weights and indexes for deriving the fair share of token incentives from the common stake pool, mapping the number of subscribers, adjusting the spam rating, etc.

## Key data stored on chain 

* Type of channel
* Channel status
* Stake pool contribution
* Time at which the channel was created \(block number\)
* Mapping of its subscribers
* Mapping of key data points of subscribers for calculating their fair share from the derived token incentives of the channel
