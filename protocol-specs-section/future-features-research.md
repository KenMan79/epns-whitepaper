# Future Features & Research

The following future features are getting researched on

* Exploring IPNS \(DNS\) [\[7\]](../references-section/references.md) for IPFS as a means to form a decentralized communication system between users.
* IPNS is a static file on IPFS that points to your website that's hosted on IPFS.
* We are researching ways in which we can use this to potentially form several communication point that are enabled between user to user.
* This can lead to exciting possibilities, for example, **having a chat thread** on IPFS that carries with itself the previous hash \(cid\) and IPNS keeps on updating the latest hash as a pointer towards that chat.
* This can also be explored to give way to possible **decentralized video messaging** and other exciting breakthroughs.

Since this is at research phase, we will update the paper once we have carried out a PoC in this regard.
