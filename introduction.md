# 1. Introduction

The blockchain space is growing at an extremely rapid pace and the exponential growth is projected to continue rapidly both in terms of users, services and revenue \[1\]. Despite this growth and expanding usage of blockchain tech, the services \(dApps, services, smart contracts\) still lack a genuine communication channel with their users.

Instead, dApps, smart contracts or services still expect the user to come to them. This is very similar to early 2003 era of internet where users were expected to perform an action, come back later and check if the results of those actions \(Gmail, Orkut, etc\). This is not the case with web 2.0 services now and no service expects users to come to them, instead they reach out to their users informing them about certain important events or further actions required. This is made possible with the invention of modern push notifications.

However, for web 3.0, there still **doesn't exists a** **notification mechanism** that can notify users\(wallet addresses\) of important updates, events, actions, etc. This flawed mechanism has already led to some side effects:

This is a major issue in adoption and the problem will worsen as more and more services come to blockchain.
