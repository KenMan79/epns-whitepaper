# Sending notifications

## Concept

EPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that abstracts the data layer to enable sending notifications to both decentralized and centralized carriers.

* Sending notifications on chain is free and no fees is charged for delivering notifications to decentralized carriers.
* A minor fee in **$ETH** is charged when the notification needs to be carried from decentralized to centralized carriers and finally to centralized platform which requires infrastructure and a business model to maintain it.

The protocol charges micro fees on notifications that are sent out. The fees from this goes to the revenue pool of the protocol. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The revenue pool in the future might support not only the EPNS infra but also other third party teams building centralized carriers on top of the notification protocol.
