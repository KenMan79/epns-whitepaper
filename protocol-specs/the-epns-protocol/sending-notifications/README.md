# Sending notifications

## Concept

EPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that abstracts the data layer to enable sending notifications to both decentralized and centralized carriers.

* Sending notifications on chain is free and no fees is charged for delivering notifications to decentralized carriers.
* A minor fee in **$ETH** is charged when the notification needs to be carried from decentralized to centralized carriers and finally to centralized platform which requires infrastructure and a business model to maintain it.
* This fees is split 80:20. 80% goes to the provider running the infrastructure \(currently only EPNS infrastructure\) but provisions in the protocol will exists to have additional infra services that can build on top of the protocol and compete.
* 20% of the fees goes to the protocol token holders who can withdraw this portion reserved for them, like dividend.

The protocol charges micro fees on notifications that are sent out. The fees from this goes to the revenue pool of the protocol.
