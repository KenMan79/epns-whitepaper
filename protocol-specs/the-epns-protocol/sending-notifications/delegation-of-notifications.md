# Delegation of notifications

## Concept

The channel can also opt to delegate sending notification from another wallet address in the protocol, if the delegation is present, that wallet can send notification on the protocol on behalf of that channel. The delegation can be revoked at any point of time by the channel owner.

This is useful in providing value added services to the channels and having mechanisms which can be used by EPNS infrastructure or other third party infrastructure to send notifications on chain on a channels' behalf.
