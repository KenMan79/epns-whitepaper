# The EPNS Protocol

Ethereum Push Notification Service protocol will be on the Ethereum blockchain that provides and standardizes the ways by which notification on blockchain can operate. 

The protocol will handle the following features:

* Types of Channels
* Activating a Channel
* Subscribing to a channel \(Direct Action of user\) 
* Indirect Subscribing of the user by the channel \(By paying user their custom set price\)
* Maintaining channel spam rating, subscribers and their share of generated interest
* Generating and maintaining Interest pool for the user
* Spam protection for users
* Sending notifications to users
* Maintaining public key registry of all users

In the future, the protocol can also support other blockchain by exploring bridging or migrating the contract and service to a particular blockchain.
