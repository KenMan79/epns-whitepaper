# Unsubscribing from Channel

## Concept

The channel has no control on the unsubscribing action of its' subscriber. Though the subscriber can indicate whether they are unsubscribing because:

* They don't want to receive notification from the channel anymore, in which case, the channel spam score is unaffected.
* However, if the subscriber indicates that they unsubscribed due to spam then the spam score of the channel is affected as outlined in [channel's spam score and throttling](../channels/spam-rating-and-throttling.md).
