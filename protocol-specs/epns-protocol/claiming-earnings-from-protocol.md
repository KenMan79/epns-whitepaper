# Claiming Earnings from Protocol

## Claiming Earnings

The protocol provides ways to earn for users based on some of their direct or indirect actions. These include earnings resulting from:

* Subscribing to channels by their direct action \(earn interest\).
* Indirect subscribe by a channel \(channel pays user either a default minor reward or the expectation set by the user\).

These earnings are mapped to the user in the protocol and the user is free to claim these anytime they want to. The earning are generated and kept as [aDai \(AAVE Interest bearing DAI\)](https://aave.com/aTokens) for users to keep generating interest automatically for them. They are converted to protocol tokens when the user withdraws them.
