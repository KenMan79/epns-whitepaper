# Sending notifications

## Concept

EPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that abstracts the data layer to enable sending notifications to both decentralized and centralized carriers.

* Sending notifications on-chain is free and no fee is charged for delivering notifications to decentralized carriers.
* A minor fee in **$ETH** is charged when the notification needs to be carried from decentralized to centralized carriers and finally to a centralized platform which requires infrastructure and a business model to maintain it.

The protocol charges micro fees on notifications that are sent out. The fees from this goes to the revenue pool of the protocol. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The revenue pool in the future might support sending fees to EPNS infra along or to other third party solutions offering infra service for decentralized to centralized carriers.
