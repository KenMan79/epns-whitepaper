# Sending Notifications

## Concept

EPNS is a decentralized notification protocol that abstracts the data layer to enable sending notifications to both decentralized and centralized carriers.

* Sending notifications on-chain is free and no fee is charged for delivering notifications to decentralized carriers.
* A minor fee in **$ETH** is charged when the notification needs to be carried from decentralized to centralized carriers and finally to a centralized platform which requires infrastructure and a business model to maintain it.

The protocol charges micro fees on notifications that are sent out. The fees from this goes to the fee pool of the protocol. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The fee pool is divided into 20:80 ratio. 80% of the fee goes to the protocol token holders while 20% is reserved for future upkeep of the protocol / product.
