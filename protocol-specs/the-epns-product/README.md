# EPNS Products

## Problem Statement

EPNS notification protocol implements game theory, DeFi incentives and enable sending decentralized push notification in platform agnostic fashion. It's designed to be integrated with third party wallets so that notifications could finally arrive and achieve the network effect on blockchain.

Despite this, it does suffer from the classic **chicken and egg problem**! Which is, in order for dApps or services to implement the protocol, they would want the notifications to be delivered to their users and see the value before adopting it to **send notification**, and unless they adopt it, it's going to be tough for user wallets to spend time in integrating a protocol ****and frontend for **receiving notification**.

## Solution

In order to facilitate the adoption of the protocol and to provide value to services, we are introducing the product suite of EPNS which includes:

* **Mobile App**: that lets users sign in with their public key and start receiving notifications from channels.
* **dApp**: to receive push notifications from web in decentralized fashion and to enable centralized web browser notification.
* **EPNS Infra \(Push Service\)**: to enable carrying notifications from EPNS protocol on decentralized layer to centralized solutions \(iOS, Android, Web, etc\)
* **EPNS JS Library**: to enable quick integration from third party dApps, servers. 
* **Showrunners**: These are channels created and run by us for the benefit of the community and for users to come and see why push notifications transformed the traditional world. Few example of showrunners which we will be running are 
  * **Wallet crypto movement tracker**
  * **ENS domain expiry**
  * **Compound liquidation alert** 
  * **EthGas abnormal price alerter**
  * **Crypto price tracker** 

We see these products to enable instant value add to the protocol and help in increasing awareness and drive adoption of the protocol.
