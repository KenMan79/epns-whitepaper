# 2. The EPNS Protocol

Ethereum Push Notification Service \(EPNS\) is a protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that provides and standardizes the ways by which notification on blockchain can operate in a future forward, flexible and decentralized way.

At its' heart, the protocol gives control to the user to subscribe to a service, who activate themselves by staking 50 DAI or higher on the protocol, which is then deposited in a interest generating protocol \(AAVE at the present\), which in turn is shared by all the subscribers of the service as a reward. 

The protocol attaches weights and indexes to all the services and subscribers in order to distribute the interest earned in a weighted manner among the subscribers, the weight always prefers the earliest block number or the earliest subscriber \(ie: user who subscribe of block 1 will earn more than the subscriber of block 10\).
